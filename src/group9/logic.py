    This function checks whether applying a normalizing function has changed the text.
    If there is a modification in the text, the mistake is logged in the database for further analysis.

    The primary goal of this function is to monitor if the text undergoes a transformation that corresponds to a mistake.
    If a mistake occurs, it is captured and stored in the database.

    The normalizing function is applied to the provided text before the change, and the result is compared with the original.
    If the text has been modified, the mistake is saved in the database.

    Parameters:
    - normalizing_function: The normalization function that applies a specific transformation to the text.
    - text_before_change: The original version of the input text.
    - text_after_change: The text after applying the normalizing function. (Initially set to None)
    - text_id: A unique identifier for the text in the database.
    - username: The username of the user making the changes.
    - mistake_type: The type of mistake that was potentially corrected by the normalization.
    - db_connection: The connection object for accessing the database.

    Returns:
    - None: This function does not return any values but interacts directly with the database to log mistakes.

    This function applies a series of text normalizations based on the user's preferences and saves the mistakes.

    The process involves running various normalization functions such as correcting spacing, removing diacritics,
    handling repeated characters, converting numbers, and more. Each normalization is applied individually based on user selections.

    The function also tracks and logs any mistakes made during the normalization process. A mistake is logged in the database 
    if a normalization is applied and the text changes as a result.

    Additionally, if the same text has been processed previously by the same user on the same day, the system will prevent 
    redundant normalization actions by checking for text existence before performing operations.

    After each normalization step, the modified text is saved in the database, and the final optimized output is returned.

    Parameters:
    - input: The original text provided by the user that needs to be normalized.
    - user: The current authenticated user whose preferences and history are used in the process.
    - correct_spacing: A boolean flag indicating whether spacing corrections should be applied.
    - remove_diacrities: A boolean flag indicating whether diacritics should be removed.
    - remove_special_chars: A boolean flag indicating whether special characters should be removed.
    - decrease_repeated_chars: A boolean flag indicating whether repeated characters should be reduced.
    - persian_style: A boolean flag indicating whether Persian-style formatting should be applied.
    - persian_number: A boolean flag indicating whether Persian numbers should replace Arabic numerals.
    - unicodes_replacement: A boolean flag indicating whether Unicode characters should be replaced with corresponding text.
    - seperate_mi: A boolean flag indicating whether "می" and "نمی" should be separated with a half-space.
    - db_connection: The connection object used to interact with the database.

    Returns:
    - partially_normalized_output: The fully normalized version of the input text after applying all selected normalizations.
