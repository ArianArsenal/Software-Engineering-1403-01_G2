    If the HTTP request method is POST, it means the user has submitted the registration form. The view extracts the submitted data:

    It checks if the passwords match, and if the username is already taken. If there are any issues, the function will return appropriate error messages.
    
    If everything is valid, a new user is created using Django's `create_user` method. After saving the user to the system, the user details are also stored in the custom database using the `save_user` function. 

    If the user is created successfully, they are redirected to the login page. If there are any errors during the process, an appropriate error message is displayed.

    - request: The HTTP request object.
